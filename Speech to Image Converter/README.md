# Speech to Image converter
Haphazardly strung together from two examples:
- [Easy Speech to Text with Python](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/06/easy-speech-text-python.html)
- [DALL-E](https://github.com/DevilEars/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/dalle/Image_generations_edits_and_variations_with_DALL-E.ipynb)

## How do I get it to run?
- You need an Open AI API key. Your key should go in the *constants* file
- You need to install all the packages
- Run *main* and follow the command prompts. There is no GUI yet. Sorry.
